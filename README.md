.NET Aspire

    *   cloud ready stack 
    
        *   for building observable, production ready, distributed applications. 
        
    *   delivered through a collection of NuGet packages

Cloud-native apps often consist of small, interconnected pieces or microservices rather than a single, monolithic code base. Cloud-native apps generally consume a large number of services

Aspire template `aspire-starter` contains sample client app implemented in ASP.net Blazor:

```
dotnet new aspire-starter -o AspireStarter
```

Extending Blazor/Web client to other types of client apps (Console, Desktop, MAUI)
